##Data dictionary for tidy_data.txt

tidy_data.txt contains 68 variables (columns) with details as below:

Column 1: subject (data type class: integer)
Identifier of the subject (person) who carried out the experiment. Its range is from 1 to 30. Subject data in tidy_data.txt are taken from subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt data sets 

Column 2: activity (data type class: character)
The activity that person performed. There are six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING). Activity data in tidy_data.txt are taken from y_train.txt and y_test.txt data sets

Column 3 - 68 (data type class: numeric)
Average values, per each subject and each activity, of measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. The average data for each measurement in tidy_data.txt are calculated from data both train (X_train.txt) and test (X_test.txt) data sets
